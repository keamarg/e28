## Notes for instructor
+ I actually added https, but ended up removing it again, because I kept getting redirected to the wrong URL when going through https (the e28api url gave me the p3 url for some reason). I ended up deciding it wasn't worth the time, but I am pretty sure I could get it to work if I gave it another shot.
